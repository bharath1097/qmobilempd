MPD (musicpd) client completly written in QT4 without external dependencies. Especially for mobile devices

At the moment I'm writting a QT Quick(QML) version of qmobilempd, so it is ready for Symbian Anna,Belle and Meego on the N9(maybe). Stay tuned for updates.

**No more updates through nokia store. Newest version is 1.0.8 see in downloads. You have to reinstall product**

Latest version = 1.0.7(normal qt)/1.0.8(qml) see [changelog](http://code.google.com/p/qmobilempd/wiki/Changelog)
